<!--Introduce your projects by taking a screenshot or a gif. Try to tell visitors a story about your project by answering:

You can find a demo of this project [here](https://fastidious-squirrel-30793a.netlify.app/)

Since making Websites responsive is a skill that I need to improve, building all the projects from devChallenges.io regarding Responsive Web design should be a good start :)
